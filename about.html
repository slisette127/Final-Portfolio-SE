  <div id="aboutMe">
    <p> My name is Sandra.
    <br>I am a wife and step-mother to an amazing 10 year old. I believe that it is never too late to start over. To borrow a quote from Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein, "A man can change his stars." With kindness and a whole lot of determination, anything is possible. Being adaptable and inquisitive keeps my life from becoming tedious. There is always something to learn or experience. Failure has never been a deterrent. Everyone fails at some point in their lives. It is just as much apart of the journey as succeeding, albeit not as enjoyable.

      I started my creative journey at a young age by wanting to become a fashion designer. That desire led me to Nashville, TN where I attained a bachelor's degree in Fashion Design and Merchandising. After a few years my desire to spread my wings led me to Los Angeles, CA. Having aquired the technical skills from the fashion world, it was an easy leap to become a professional seamstress for tv and film. My work has traveled the world and you would never know it was made by me. Being behind the scenes has always been where I prefer to be. I enjoy helping others shine. After almost a decade in the sun, it was time to return to Texas. Here I ventured into the world of Interior Design.For the past three years I have worked as a Regional Decorator for a chain of furniture stores. This year, I decided it was time for a complete change. I wanted to have a career that would challenge me as well as withstand pandemics and recessions.
