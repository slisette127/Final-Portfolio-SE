    <h1>HTML or HT-FML?</h1><br>
    Coding is both intriguing and confusing. It’s like a secret language that seems so inaccessible and mysterious. And still, I wanted to learn it. The idea of creating something that can change lives and be shared with the world is beyond exciting. As I sat at brunch with my three girlfriends listening to them go on about yet another failed relationship, I couldn’t help but wonder: has fear of the unknown held me back from changing the world? <br>

    <h1>Whistle While You Code</h1> <br>  
    Dearest Reader,
The social season is upon us. Or rather, day two of the first week of this grand adventure we call… bootcamp. On this most auspicious day, this author has dipped her toes into the waters of using Flex. It is most intriguing to be able to change the direction and style by merely adding CSS commands under the “display: flex.” This class has furthered my understanding of structure and, armed with this new knowledge, will be able to create beautiful websites. <br>

    <h1>Meow It’s JavaScript</h1> <br>
    Hey all you cool cats and kittens! Carole here to explain all the wonderful details about Javascript and CSS. Buckle in because we’re in for a wild ride! JavaScript and CSS couldn’t be more different. To put it simply, JavaScript is like me, Carole Baskin at Big Cat Rescue. While CSS is like my nemesis Joe Exotic, who is currently incarcerated. CSS is static and is all about style. It will define things like background color, font properties, and basically anything that makes the page look good. Much like Joe, it’s all about appearances. <br>
